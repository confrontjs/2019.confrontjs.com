            Constructed in 1955, the Palace of Culture and Science divides
            Warsaw’s inhabitants into those who still hate it and those who
            learned how to live in its presence. This ‘gift of the Soviet people
            to the Polish nation’, offered by Joseph Stalin himself, has become
            one of the city’s most widely recognised symbols. The Palace houses
            a cinema, a swimming pool, four museums, four theaters,
            four universities and numerous coffee stores and bars.
            Visitors can also take advantage of the terrace located on the
            30th floor, offering a mesmerising view of the city’s panorama.
