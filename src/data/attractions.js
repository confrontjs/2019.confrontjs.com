            Constructed in 1955, the Palace of Culture and Science divides
            Warsaw’s inhabitants into those who still hate it and those who
            learned how to live in its presence. This ‘gift of the Soviet people
            to the Polish nation’, offered by Joseph Stalin himself, has become
            one of the city’s most widely recognised symbols. The Palace houses
            a cinema, a swimming pool, four museums, four theaters,
            four universities and numerous coffee stores and bars.
            Visitors can also take advantage of the terrace located on the
            30th floor, offering a mesmerising view of the city’s panorama.

            Included on the UNESCO World Heritage list, Warsaw’s Old Town was
            completely rebuilt after World War II, based mostly on 18th century
            paintings by the Italian painter Canaletto. The heart of the area,
            guarded proudly by the Warsaw mermaid, is the Old Town Market Place
            with its restaurants and cafés. Visitors should also make sure to see
            the Barbican and St. John’s Cathedral, as well as explore the
            picturesque winding streets.

            The park-and-palace complex Łazienki Królewskie has all the elements
            of a great city park: a lake with palace on the water, as well as
            a botanical garden and an amphitheatre with free plays, performances
            and Chopin concerts during the summer months. Located in the city
            centre and spanning 76 hectares, this park is a great place to visit
            on a hot summer’s day.

            leading painters, including Jan Matejko and Józef Cheamoaski.
            The museum is also known for its engaging temporary exhibitions,
            so be sure to check out what they have currently on display before you visit.
