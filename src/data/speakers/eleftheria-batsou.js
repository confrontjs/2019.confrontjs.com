        en: "Hi there, I’m Eleftheria, no one can really pronounce or remember my name so you can just call me Elli :) I currently work as an app developer and I'm freelancing as a content creator for Udemy, PacktPub and Skillshare. In my free time, I create youtube videos about being a better developer, improving your career as well as tutorials and “how-to”. Since I work daily for a lot of hours I also try to stay active as much as possible, I love working out, going for long walks in nature or spending quality time with friends. I enjoy interacting and connecting with others, I like to share my passions and being sociable :)"
