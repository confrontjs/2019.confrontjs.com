                    If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
                    concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible.
                    The conference organizers are:<br/>

                    <strong>Katarzyna Grabowska</strong>, <strong>Piotr Kowalski</strong>
                    and <strong>Piotr Zientara</strong>. You can contact them directly or
                    via <a href="https://warsawjs.slack.com">warsawjs.slack.com</a> Additionally,
                    community organizers are available to help community members engage
                    with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
                    unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events,
                    organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing
                    distress.<br/><br/>

                    A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this
                    <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors,
                    with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are
                    committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
                    regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
                    status and religion (or lack thereof).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> outlines our expectations for all those who participate
                    in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safe
                    and positive experiences for everyone.
