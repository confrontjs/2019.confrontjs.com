        <p>Łukasiewicz Research Network – Institute of Aviation</p>

        <p>
            Engineering Design Center (EDC) was created in April 2000 under
            an agreement between General Electric Aircraft Engines and Warsaw
            Institute of Aviation (now Łukasiewicz Research Network – Institute of
            Aviation). EDC is one of several global GE establishments located outside
            the United States and cooperates with such GE businesses as GE Aviation,
            GE Power. It also carries out cooperative works with similar GE scientific
            and engineering centers located in India, Mexico, Turkey and the United States.
            The engineers working in EDC cooperate also with GE’s partners located,
            among others, in Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Romania, South Korea
            and Taiwan.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first stage of its activities, the engineers working in EDC were
            involved mainly in projects in the field of aviation. In 2007, the first
            group of engineers started working in projects in the field of energy
            and petroleum industry. Currently, nearly half of the engineers employed
            in EDC are related with these two areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engineers working in EDC are engaged in the design and improvement
            of parts of units of aircraft engines, turbine propulsion systems for
            ships and turbines for land applications (using of the so-called
            areoderivative gas engines as electricity generators), high-power gas
            turbines, steam turbines, as well as power boilers and environment
            protection equipment, such as filters and electrostatic precipitators.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engineers from EDC are also involved in design, analysis
            and servicing of such machines as compressors, turbonexpanders and gas
            turbines used in the petroleum and chemical industries. EDC also carries
            out activities related to supporting production and testing of parts
            and components.
