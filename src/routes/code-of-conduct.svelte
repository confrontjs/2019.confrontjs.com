    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
        concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible. The
        conference organizers are: Katarzyna Grabowska, Piotr Kowalski and Piotr
        Zientara. You can contact them directly or via warsawjs.slack.com
        Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
        engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
        unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events,
        organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing
        distress.
